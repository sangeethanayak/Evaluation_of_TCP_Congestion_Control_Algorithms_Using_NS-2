# Evaluation of TCP Congestion Control Algorithms Using NS-2
## Abstract
This project conducts a comprehensive evaluation of multiple TCP congestion control algorithms using the NS-2 simulation tool. The study explores how these algorithms perform under various network conditions and provides valuable insights into their adaptability and effectiveness in managing network congestion. By implementing and testing algorithms like Standard, New Reno, Vegas in diverse network scenarios, this research contributes to the understanding of how different congestion control mechanisms impact network performance. The findings offer guidance for selecting the most suitable congestion control algorithm for specific network environments, ultimately optimizing data transmission and resource allocation in real-world networking scenarios. Additionally, this project aims to assess the impact of these congestion control algorithms on Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, such as throughput and packet loss.
